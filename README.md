## Description

A simple utility app that lists all your installed apps (optionally including system apps), with
detailed version information.

## Future plans

The first version will only list local apps on the current device. The preliminary plan for version
2 is to have a true app "matrix", i.e. an overview of all apps installed across multiple devices,
synced to the user's Google account.
